# Paths to directories have the form of windows paths.
# See at the end for an example of how to use this function efficiently

## Input:
#   a MED raw file in the form of time.event convention.
## Output:
#   a csv with two columns: time and events

#' Process MED to csv based on standard data structure event.time
#'
#' @param fname chr, the name of a MED file to read; can include the path directory
#' @param save_file logical, Save csv? TRUE or FALSE (default)
#' @param path_save chr, Path to folder to save csv files;
#' @param col_r chr, Variable of MED-raw to read (a event.time variable)
#' @param out logical, output the dataframe processed?
#'
#' @return
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' ## Example of use:
#' # 1) Generate a list of filenames of raw MED data
#' # 2) Loop over the list with the function, using each element
#' #    of the list as the fname argument.

#' # Suppose all raw MED files start with 2020, and you are in the working directory (wd)
#' # If all the raw MED files are in the wd, we can directly write

#' # filenames = list.files(pattern = "^2020")

#' # The above line will look in the wd for all the files starting with "2020"m
#' # and it will save it as a vector of strings in "filenames".
#' # With that vector, make a for loop like the following:

#' # If you want to work immediately with the processed data, first create an empty
#' # dataframe to store the data file per file
#' # df_working = data.frame()

#' # for (f in filenames) {
#' #   df_tmp = read_med(fname = f,
#' #                     path_save = "", # put here your path to save the csv
#' #                     col_r = 'C:', # if you want to process variable C
#' #                     out = T ) # If you want to store processed data in df_tmp,
#' # otherwise write out = F
#' #   df_working = rbind(df_working, df_tmp)
#' # }

#' # Thats all.
