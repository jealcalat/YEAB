\title{Individual trial analysis for peak procedure data}
\usage{
low1_s1_high_s2_low2(r_times, trial_duration)
}
\arguments{
\item{r_times}{numeric, the times that a response was emitted in a trial}

\item{trial_duration}{numeric, the peak trial duration}
}
\value{
a data.frame of start, stop, spread, middle time (mid) and the response
rate at each state (r1 for low, r2 for high and r3 for the second low rate state)
}
